# PuzzleBox

This final project was a accumulation of the knowledge learned through the Assembler course of the Whitworth CS Program.

# How to run the program as developer of box:
1. Create .hex file and program code to metro board (this code was created and run in the latest version of Visual Studio Code)
2. Program code to metro board (this code was created and run in the latest version of Visual Studio Code)
3. NOTE: For how to actually use the box, see the "Manual for Use" in the documentation folder. For a visual demonstration of how the box works, see the Youtube link in "VideoLink.md"

# Things that could be used to improve the design given the knowledge I have now:
1. The biggest thing I would have loved to add to this puzzle box was to add some sort of display that indicates how close the temperature is to reaching it's goal. Currently you just have to constantly check if the puzzle status LED turns on, but adding some sort of indicator to tell you how close you are would have been a great addition to the puzzle box.
2. Another thing I would have loved to add to the design would have been to add variety of different sensors. In this version I only used a matrix keypad and a temperature sensor for creating the 3 different puzzles. Adding in something like a joystick or some motion sensors would have made the puzzle box more interesting.
3. Creating a better locking system for the puzzle box would have been something I wish I had more time to work on. The current locking system is not secure and can easily be opened through brute force (and not much I might add). Creating a better locking system would have resulted in it seeming more like a puzzle box as you would have actually had to gone through the effort of doing the puzzles to open the box.
4. I wish I could have added some sort of indicator when someone got a puzzle wrong (i.e. input an incorrect code). Having some sort of indicator would have made the box more user friendly and relied less on the user to know where they are at in a puzzle.
